## How to build game.

1. Install Godot Engine 4.2.2
2. Open Godot Engine and click Project -> Export.
3. Install export templates for Godot.
4. Choose your *desktop* platform and compile it in your folder. 

> Touchscreen platforms are also supported, but due to Godot 4.2 OpenGL renderer incompleteness, it is **not** recommended to export to *mobile* platforms
